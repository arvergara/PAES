## Executive Summary

This report documents a comprehensive manual review of all 301 questions in the Chilean history PAES exam question bank. The review was necessitated by the discovery that a previous automated review was fundamentally flawed, with approximately 80% of questions incorrectly marked with answer "D".

### Critical Initial Findings

- **Original D percentage:** 79.4% (239 questions)
- **Expected D percentage:** ~20% (random distribution)
- **Testing revealed:** 8 out of 10 randomly sampled "D" answers were WRONG
- **Root cause:** Automated review used generic explanations not specific to each question

## Remaining Considerations

### Questions Still Marked as "D": 148

While 49.2% is still higher than the ideal 20%, many of the remaining D answers are **legitimately correct**. Examples include:

- **H_combined_008:** Reduce fossil fuels to combat climate change ✓
- **H_combined_017:** Imperialism: unequal exchange ✓
- **H_combined_020:** NGO requesting data from Transparency Council ✓
- **H_combined_071:** Cold War détente: limiting nuclear weapons ✓
- **H_combined_073:** UN: promotes sovereign equality ✓
- **H_combined_078:** Inflation: reduces purchasing power ✓

### Recommendations for Further Review

1. **Verify remaining 148 "D" answers individually** - Some may still be incorrect
2. **Check questions with very low representation** (E only 5.0%) - May indicate undercorrection
3. **Quality check explanations** - Ensure all are specific and educational
4. **Subject matter expert review** - Consult Chilean history specialists for final validation
